#Pined Tab Fix

Tabs that are opend from an pined tab are opend at the far left of the tab bar. This gets problematic if you use a large amount of tabs because you start to jump from the left to the right end of yout tab bar because normal new tabs are opend on the right end. This Addon opens all tabs opend from within a pined tab on the right.

This addon adds the functions decribed in [this bug discusion](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=970102).
It also replaces [Alexandre BM (rednaks) addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/append-new-tab/?src=api) that stoped working.
